This is just a project which I am currently making in the Godot Game Engine

What is it's purpose? 
Well, to be very honest, I am just using this as a means of integrating the use of git in all of my projects and to learn the usage of git in various scenarios.

Any reason for making it public?
Not really, no. I just couldn't wrap my head around how to implement github in a way such that friends can use the same private repository together

Is this project ever going to be something big? 

Nope. Atleast that's what I think. A bunch of amateur devs who have not really understood the principles of game development don't stand a chance to crack into anything(Well, we are just two)

Are you having fun writing this readme?
YES!! It's extremely fun to be able to write something without even thinking about setting it to a particular font or things like that!  (tbh, VIM is better)
