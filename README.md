# What is this project?
This is nothing but a small project which I will be working on and off for the next few months (hopefully).

## Why did you make this project public? 
Well, to be perfectly honest, I was having trouble getting this to work with just two people working on the project. 
It started becoming a pain in the ass to even bother setting up tokens for a project that will just fly under every persons radar.

## Why are you making a ReadMe after so Long?

Well, I noticed that having the readme file of a plugin wouldn't be a good look for the project, so I decided to change it. 
Also, I once tried to edit the readme, but I didn't know how markdown text worked (well, I didn't even know it was called as **Markdown**, am I _right?_).
However, since I started using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), I feel right at home typing in _Markdown_

### Let's have some fun,
Markdown allows you to edit text in a pretty much normal fashion, but you have to use symbols in order to make any changes to type of script.

Note that you can only identify these script symbols only if you go in the edit option on the top right of the **ReadMe**
# This is a heading
## This is a subheading
### This is an even smaller heading
**This is Bold**
_This is italic_
***This is a bold and italic***
**This bold with _italic in between_, understand?**
